# VEHICLE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Problem Statement:
Designing a Vehicle Management System specifically for college faculty use. 
This system will facilitate the reservation of vehicles for various purposes such as 
industrial visits (IV), guest pick-up, and medical usage. The system will enable users 
to check vehicle availability, submit booking requests, receive confirmation 
notifications, and manage their bookings efficiently. Upon confirmation, users will 
also be informed about the driver allotted for the vehicle for that particular trip.

Overview:
The System aims to enable college faculty to manage their transportation 
needs effectively by providing a platform to book vehicles based on availability. The 
system will also help administrators to manage vehicle details, booking requests, and 
driver assignments efficiently
